# About the Program
We use green tick to represent that the page is safe, and red cross to indicate that the page is potentially dangerous. The threshold we set is 0.3. If the page has 30% different compared to last time user activated, the extension will consider this page hazard, and will mark the difference on the current page. Users can remove the marked differece by clicking anywhere on the screen. Users can use this [link](http://azarask.in/blog/post/a-new-type-of-phishing-attack/) to check it out.
